## 🚀 Features

### **1. Create Invoices 📝**
Users can create detailed invoices for specific addresses by defining:  
- **Products or Services Provided**: A breakdown of all items/services.  
- **Total Amount Due**: The sum that needs to be paid by the other party.  

### **2. Address-Specific Payment 💳**  
Each invoice is linked to a unique **wallet address** of the recipient. Only that user can pay the invoice, ensuring transactions are secure and targeted.  

### **3. Immutable Record of Payments 🔒**  
Once an invoice is created and paid, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent and tamper-proof.  

### **4. Downloadable Receipt 📥**  
After the payment is completed, the payer can download a receipt that includes all details of the transaction for record-keeping purposes.  

### **5. Blockchain-Powered Transparency 🌐**  
Every transaction and invoice is permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring trust and verifiability.

## 🚀 How It Works  

### 1. **Invoice Creation**  
The user (seller) creates an invoice, specifying:  
- Recipient's wallet address.  
- List of items or services provided.  
- Total amount to be paid.  

### 2. **Payment Processing**  
The recipient (buyer) reviews the invoice, verifies the details, and makes the payment via blockchain.  

### 3. **Receipt Generation**  
Once payment is complete, a digital receipt is automatically generated. The buyer can download the receipt for their records.
